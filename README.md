# Elm



Web App 


### Web App 

my web app was created as a game, similar to a drawing connect the dots game. 
the aim is to connect the dots and create the star using the directed code of colours on the side.
the controls of w,s,a,d control the movements up and down. 
the enter button draws the line 


```
Controls : W, S , D, A, Enter
```

# Challenges 
Using elm was challenging because it is a pure functional language. Therefore it was not something i was used to. Specifically creating the line to connect the dots was very difficult.

# How I Overcame 
I used the different features of elm to create a web app that i thought used the functional language in a unique way. I used the functional aspects of elm to create the line through recursion.

# Run App 
1. To run app dowload git repo 
2. In terminal install elm : `npm install -g elm` 
3.  Enter `elm make WebApp.elm` 
4. Run `elm reactor` 
5. On the website `http://localhost:8000/` you will find the WebApp running
